        <h3>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTsâ€”unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. 
            Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</h3>
