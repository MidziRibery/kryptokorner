# Krypto Korner App

A client-based app for getting the latest information (real time price) and to understand the basics of cryptocurrencies and NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens).

## Background

The world of crypto is not only vast, but changing on a daily basis! With so many information out there, it is easy for someone new to get lost with all these everchanging information bombarding you!

This app aims to simplify and introduce new crypto users to back to basic concepts of the whole crypto space.

It will introduce users to the cryptocurrency that started it all (Bitcoin), the technology behind it, and the early cryptocurrencies who built on the technology to incorporate and improve how traditional finances (TradFi) works.

This app will also share the basic concept of what an NFT is, and why it is valued at such high prices.

Therefore, it will be broken down into 3 simple sections:

1. Sharing of 5 cryptocurrencies that one has to know and understand if they are to dwell further into the space.
2. Some basic sharing of the top NFTs in their own cyrptocurrency environment.
3. Other cryptocurrencies basic knowledge.

## How it works

All data is managed locally in your browser by the app except for the price fetching.

The app communicates with external sources is when you perform a search for prices by clicking on the cryptocurrency â€” the app will fetch relevant data from the Library API.
